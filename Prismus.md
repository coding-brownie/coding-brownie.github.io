In this semester project we had to implement a game in a small team of 3 people. The overarching theme was Evolution. We went with a top-down game, where the player takes control of a small creature whose goal is to grow and evolve to become stronger. We took inspiration from games like Flow... The technical challenges were mainly the enemy AI and pathfinding, environment animations, as well as the procedural level generator using perlin-noise.
