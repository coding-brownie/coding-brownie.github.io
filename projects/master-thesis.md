<h3 class="intro-text">
    For my master's thesis, I extended an existing story pre-viz framework called <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/2017/07/30/computational-narrative/">CANVAS</a> with the ability to generate interactive stories and measuring the user's engagement to make recommendations regarding which future branch in the story should be taken and nudging the user to take the required actions.
</h3>
<p>
    The main tasks of my master thesis were to <b>1)</b> integrate modes of user interaction within the existing story framework, <b>2)</b> extending the story framework to support branching, <b>3)</b> accommodate user-interactions at any time through online planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), <b>4)</b> observing the user's interests and matching them to the possible future branches in the story, <b>5)</b> nudging the user into taking certain actions to get on the best future story path. <br/>
