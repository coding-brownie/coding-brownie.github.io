    In the Gamelab course of ETH Zurich, the students are tasked to create a game from the ground up over the course of a semester. The overarching theme of that year was Evolution. In a group of 3 people, I helped developing the game "Prismus" and learned a lot in the process.

<h2>The Game</h2>
"Prismus" is a top-down game, where the player takes control of a small creature whose goal is to grow, evolve, adapt to the environment and survive for as long as possible. Our main inspiration for "Prismus" was the game <a href="https://thatgamecompany.com/flow/">"flOw"</a>. 

<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
The technical challenges for "Prismus" were threefold: <b>1)</b> procedurally generate the game environment with perlin-noise and adapting it to the size of the player's creature, <b>2)</b> develop an enemy AI that is capable of navigating through the procedurally generated levels and attack or flee from the player, and <b>3)</b> creating animations for the different environmental elements.
