In the Gamelab course of ETH Zurich, the students are tasked to create a game from the ground up over the course of a semester. The overarching theme of that year was Evolution. In a group of 3 people, we developed the game "Prismus" - a top-down game, where the player takes control of a small creature whose goal is to grow, evolve, adapt to the environment and survive for as long as possible. Our main inspiration for "Prismus" was the game <a href="https://thatgamecompany.com/flow/">"flOw"</a>. 

The technical challenges for "Prismus" were threefold: 1) procedurally generate the game environment with perlin-noise, adapting to the size of the player's creature, 2) develop an enemy AI that is capable of navigating through the procedural levels and attack or flee from the player, and 3) creating animations for the environmental elements.
