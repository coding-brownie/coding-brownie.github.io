<p>I worked on this project over a 3-year period at ETH Zurich in collaboration with Disney Research|Studios and the Sejong University in Seoul. The aim of the project was to develop authoring tools for AR (Augmented Reality) experiences that feature intelligent virtual characters. Specifically, the characters should be aware of their surroundings and be able to interact with it and the user, such as if they were living with us. To this end, we developed an authorable storytelling engine, a scene understanding module, animation controllers and modules related to various existing AI (artificial intelligence) technologies on top of the Unity game engine.  </p>
