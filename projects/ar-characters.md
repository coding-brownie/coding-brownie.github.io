<p>
The aim of the project was to develop authoring tools for AR (Augmented Reality) experiences that feature intelligent virtual characters. Specifically, the characters should be aware of their surroundings and be able to interact with it and the user. To this end, we developed an authorable <b>storytelling engine</b>, a <b>scene understanding</b> module, <b>3D animation controllers</b> and modules related to various existing <b>AI (artificial intelligence) technologies</b> on top of the Unity game engine.
</p>

<p>
The project was a collaboration between Disney Research|Studios and the Sejong University in Seoul. I have been the lead architect on the Swiss side and contributed to the code, coordinated the work of my colleagues and students who did their theses on this project.

<h2>Prototypes</h2>
We developed 3 major prototypes over the course of this project. 

<p>The first one was a <b>virtual museum guide</b>, who could guide the user through a physical art museum and tell stories about the painting, while pointing out the various details by hand.</p>

<p>The goal of the second one was to leverage our custom scene understanding module and animation system to interact with the detected objects. Due to the upcoming of Large Language Models (LLMs) at the time, we also integrated a proper chatbot functionality for the characters. The result was a <b>tech-demo</b>, in which a child from a different dimension comes to visit your home and is eager to explore the different treasures of your home - meaning anything that can be detected by the scene understanding module.</p>

<p>The goal of the third prototype was to build an experience that uses all the developed technologies and that could be used as a commercial app. For this we went with a <b>language practicing app</b>, where the user can choose one of three different teachers, one of 12 languages and their current level of said language. The AR teacher will offer various exercises that are connected to the objects in the room. The exercises are generated by an LLM at runtime and range from listening exercises, to discussing topics, and roleplay.</p>

<h3>Student Prototypes</h3>
<p>Further small prototypes were created by students as their bachelor's or master's project, such as talking objects, an animal pet simulation, airship battles in the living room, or a choose-your-own-adventure story generator incorporating physical objects as locations of the story.</p>
