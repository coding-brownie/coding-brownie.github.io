As a follow-up to my Master thesis, we extended the interactive storytelling framework to support real-world locations. Life-size 3D stages including actors were anchored on AR image targets and visualized in AR. The developed prototype was intended for a field-test in Bristol UK. Due to its rich history in naval discovery and pirates, the story and assets revolved around pirates.
